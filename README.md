# webdevCourse 2001 vs 2019

Contained within this blog post is a work in progress site.
The overall purpose of the site is to exercise and experience coding html, css and answer questions within the curriculum for CodeNation.
The crash course was three weeks, during which time an arrangement of challenges were thrown our way, and we were able to work as a team and operate on our own also.
