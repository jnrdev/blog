<h3>Technology Blog</h3>

<p>
Whenever I come across an intriguing subject, my mind goes into overdrive. <br>
I begin to tap into the part of my being that will stop at nothing until I have achieved my end goal.<br>
<br> <!-- This breaks or returns for a new line -->
Whilst here feel free to peruse the links at the top of the site and view a few of the things I have learnt lately.
<br>
Updates are added bi-weekly, I explore all the difficulties I experience, explaining how I overcame them.<br>
Where applicable I will include links, screenshots and all the new stuff I learnt.
In the Technology industry it is often required to invest time and attention to up and coming technologies.<br>
I hope that by reviewing my personal set backs and skimming through this blog all readers are able to be encouraged to keep on learning.<br>
