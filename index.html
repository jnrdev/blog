    Whilst here feel free to peruse the links at the top of the site and view a few of the things I have learnt lately. Updates are added bi-weekly, I explore all the difficulties I experience, explaining how I overcame them.
</p>
<p style="text-align: center">
    Where applicable I will include links, screenshots and all the new stuff I learnt. In the Technology industry it is often required to invest time and attention to up and coming technologies.<br>
    I hope that by reviewing my personal set backs and skimming through this blog all readers are able to be encouraged to keep on learning.
