    <h3>What do you need to make projects successful?</h3>
    <br>
    <p>
Keep things simple, clear, concise and understandable.<br>
We can all struggle from distractions therefore minimising these is essential, being <br>
professional is not void of being friendly but we have to draw a line on what it is we <br>
desire from our own time, since only we are responsible for where we might fail.<br>
Therefore whether producing meals for two, arranging a trip abroad for your family <br>
or ensuring relevant security measures are taken into consideration before you go to bed; <br>
basic food hygiene, a valid passport and ensure the windows and doors are locked - <br>
sure there are a few more steps to these proposed examples but these are the bare essentials.
<br> 
Are we getting validation from the right places, does our zeal for it come between our<br>
        willingness to focus and succeed or are we better focused afterwards, when is enough <br>
        enough, is this relative or objective. For this project to be successful requires one <br>
        to have aptitude to succeed, be responsible for the level of output and failure to meet deadlines. <br>
        What matters most when creating a project is the content what is thrown at you, integrity <br>
        and ambition, self control.</p>

    With a well organised IT department the data collected can help to provide a product that meets the expectations of the clientele, providing overall improvements to reach targets set for identifying and improving areas of weakness and acknowledging areas that are strong.
    Technology simplifies communication with the use of social media; newsletters and internal discussion can be streamlined making it easier to identify key focuses, concerns and consult the areas of weaknesses and strengths which will impact the overall growth of a business.

<h3>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</h3>

    <b>1.5 Describing the content and layout for each page.<b>
    <i>How do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </i> 
  <br>
<p>This is dependant on what we hope to achieve the right kind of technology will differ.   <br>
    If for example the purpose of the business could cut costs by having a simple website   <br>
    that has a database of products and the types of files, that can take payments via a    <br>
    merchant account, job done.  <br>
    Budgeting overall outcome of events is worth doing periodically throughout the project.

    A typical layout looks like this but I may adapt it afterwards; HTML, CSS, Text structure, title, Image or logo.
