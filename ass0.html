  <b>1.1 - Describing the purpose of IT in modern business.</b> <br><br>

    Information Technology in modern business plays an integral role within business; it can help to keep <br>
    track of expenditure, overall return for investment, helps to simplification of digital marketing conditions and customer satisfaction.<br>
    <br> 
    With a well organised IT department the data collected can help to provide a product that meets the expectations of the clientele, <br>
    providing overall improvements to reach targets set for identifying and improving areas of weakness and acknowledging areas that are strong.<br>
    Technology simplifies communication with the use of social media; newsletters and internal discussion can be streamlined making it easier <br>
    to identify key focuses, concerns and consult the areas of weaknesses and strengths which will impact the overall growth of a business.<br>

    <b>1.2 - Describing methods, skills and resources needed to complete digital projects successfully.</b> <br> <br>

    In order to make the project successfully requires commitment to the overall plans set out at the beginning and the willingness to overcome <br>
    the difficulties, identifying them and providing adequate solutions to those problems.<br>
    Keep things simple, clear, concise and understandable.<br>
    We can all struggle from distractions therefore minimising these is essential, being <br>
    professional is not void of being friendly but we have to draw a line on what it is we <br>
    desire from our own time, since only we are responsible for where we might fail.<br>
    Therefore whether producing meals for two, arranging a trip abroad for your family <br>
    or ensuring relevant security measures are taken into consideration before you go to bed; <br>
    basic food hygiene, a valid passport and ensure the windows and doors are locked - <br>
    sure there are a few more steps to these proposed examples but these are the bare essentials.</p>
<p> 
    Are we getting validation from the right places, does our zeal for it come between our<br>
    willingness to focus and succeed or are we better focused afterwards, when is enough <br>
    enough, is this relative or objective. For this project to be successful requires one <br>
    to have aptitude to succeed, be responsible for the level of output and failure to meet deadlines. <br>
    What matters most when creating a project is the content what is thrown at you, integrity <br>
    and ambition, self control.</p>
<hr>
<p>
<b> 1.3. Plan and carry out tasks using IT - e.g. making your website.  </b><br><br>

<i>  How will you plan it?</i> <br>
<p>
    Using existing aptitude to produce a project that achieves and overcomes calamity; like Link in the Breath of the Wild<br>
    Mainly writing the html (xhtml), css (scss) with Visual Studio Code.
        Using Trello to arrange the plan and keeping it up to date with each task.<br>
    Creating a text based use of the application forhtml and having the main content laid out the overlaying aesthetics.<br>
    Researching new ways to layout the tasks and implimenting them to improve the overall layout of the website and blog<br>
    for the content to intuitive, educational and that by going through the trials I faced, others may be able to avoid the mistakes I had made.<br>

    <b>1.4 Describe the risks that might impact digital projects.</b>
    <i>What causes digital projects to fail and why?</i><br>
    
    In my humble opinion, production values decrease in a production manufacturing site when the atmosphere and culture within the workplace<br>
    is poor, the performance of workers and enthusiasm is lacking, the lack of respect for the responcibility of management and what they do is undervalued<br>
    under appreciated.<br>
    Likewise digital projects often fail due to poor management and a lack of respect for the responcibilities of management<br>
    A main risk that digital projects face is copyrights and under the new regulations of GDPR. <br>
    This can require those who view or sell products to require something from their customers before a decision has been made<br>
    In order to prevent these occurances and legislation impacting digital projects, one must be aware of the laws and who their audience is.<br>
    Hardware and software malfunction can be abaited by regular tests - project chaos monkey has been one of my favourite<br>
    It can help to observe the repairability and the time it would take for a network issue to be resolved; whether hardware related or software related<br>
    self healing and AI properties are in increase demand because of their seemless methods and impementations.
    Other preventative measures include accountability, solutions include fault finding rather than excercising energy and effort in casting the blame,<br>
    holding those accountable for the issue is not as effective as resolving the issue and serving the clients and customers. <br>
    Reprimand can be considered after the services have been restored, if necessary.<br>

<p>
    <b>1.5 Describing the content and layout for each page.</b><br>
    <i>How do you select the right kind of technology for the job? </i> 
  <br>
    This is dependant on what we hope to achieve the right kind of technology will differ.   <br>
    If for example the purpose of the business was able to reduce costs by having a progressive web application,   <br>
    with a database. <br>
    In this case the content of the main index page would include what is available throughout the site, how to access these and go to where one would intend must be made seemless<br>
    Budgeting overall outcome of events is worth doing periodically throughout the project.
    <br>
    A typical layout looks like this but I may adapt it afterwards; HTML, CSS, Text structure, title, Image or logo.
    Header, Intro, Body; paragraph(s) Main, Ending.
