<h2 style="background-image: cross-fade(#eeee)">Thank you for joining me on this journey.</h2>
        
<p style="text-align: left">
    FYI, personally I believe socialising is best done in person, as there is nothing worse than to be misunderstood or misconstrued,<br>
    that said, being able to face this frustration and live is proof that although things can at times appear to get the better of us in the momment, in hinesight 
    there is little to no purpose to continue to dispair over, repeating an issue proves we ourselves are the ones at fault.<br><br>

<h4 style="border-style:double">Thank you, for the precious time you have taken out of your day to reveiw this site and to observe all of the mishaps, the many trials and needless errors and methods I have used to overcome the difficulties that I faced during this project.
<p style="text-align: left">
    <b>It has been quite a journey, woah!</b><br>   
    So grateful for all the input I recieved, all the lessons I learnt and the new things I am yet learning, it is so exciting!<br>
    I know, that this is only the beginning and that the end, especially this one is only the start of something great.<br>
    But what pearl of wisdom can I leave you with before I you go?<br>
