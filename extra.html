    <!-- Paragraph 1-->
<p>
    Once identifed most conflicts became a non issue, this is not because I choose to ignore them<br>
    but because I intentionally headlong separated each workload into sizable chunks; in order to achieve maximum performance.

    <!-- Paragraph 2-->
<p>
   Whenever there was something I did not know, I researched it, asked questions and challeneged <br>
   myself in order to over achieve in the field where I formerly struggled. I love challenges, <br>
   in all shapes and sizes; life itself is a challenge, either we lose our minds from focusing <br>
   too much on the mainstream media or we lose ourselves by allowing them to categorise us by <br>
   things that, realy just do not matter that much to us in the long run.

        I went with a Dell Optiplex 755 to begin with and my target Operating System was MacOS 10.8.5 [Mountain Lion]
