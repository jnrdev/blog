<h2>What did you find difficult during your project?</h2>
    <!-- Paragraph 1-->
<p>
    Once identifed most conflicts became a non issue, this is not because I choose to ignore them
    but because I intentionally headlong separated each workload into sizable chunks; in order to achieve maximum performance.
    <!-- Paragraph 2-->
<p>
   Whenever there was something I did not know, I researched it, asked questions and challeneged 
   myself in order to over achieve in the field where I formerly struggled. I love challenges, 
   in all shapes and sizes; life itself is a challenge, either we lose our minds from focusing 
   too much on the mainstream media or we lose ourselves by allowing them to categorise us by 
   things that, realy just do not matter that much to us in the long run.
