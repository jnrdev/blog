<b>2.1 Review the ongoing use of IT tools and change approach as needed – in making your own website, are you happy with the tools you used?<br>
    E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello</b> <br> <br>  

    Being unable to login to Trello and only having access to Visual Studio Code, Opera, Chrome and MoodleCloud; I made the most of what was available to me.<br>
    Codepen sign up was pretty easy and simple, using the email i had created at the begining of the course.<br>
    jnr.dev.dave@gmail.com - I signed up to Trello and created a Kanban with a layout of all the tasks I wouldl need to complete in order to make this project a success.<br>
    What had happened instead was that I had so many ideas circling around in my head and external concerns that were overwhelming me, I couldnt help but to lose focus<br>
    By escaping the tasks periodically I was able to regain focus and attend to the needs of the website, but at this stage I was far behind and needed to work even harder <br>
    in order to catch up with the workload.</p>

    <b>2.2 Describe whether the  IT tools selected were appropriate E.g. Visual Studio Code, Codepen, Trello.</b><br><br>
    Visual Studio was effective in helping me to write both html and css documents for this project and the overall outcome was easily observable via Trello<br>
    I am grateful for the use of the tools on the Codepen site and the new things I have learnt lately, Trello was effective in helping me to keep up to date<br>
    With what I had achieved and what needed to be done next and what I was working on as and when I updated it (see later answers) would have gone much more smoother<br>
    had this been a team effort rather than a solo journey -- I believe that the true intentions of this course is to overwhelm us and to have us realise <br>
    That it would be easier if the outcome was met by a groupm, one to keep on top of updating Trello, having standups so that we all know what we are doing<br>
    Someone focusing on content of the projected site and a final person to apply all the aesthetics the site would need in order to look the part of the web; <br>
    making it engaging and inviting.</p><br>

    <b>2.3 Assess the strengths and weaknesses of your final project – are you happy with your website?</b><br>
    I am unhappy with it and intend on improving the content, aesthetics and implimenting new features in the near future,<br>
    as and when I learn them, ever learning, ever growing. <br>

    <b>2.3.1 Why?</b><br><br>
    Because there was too much work for one person as a novice to actually achieve this, the outcome may have been better <br>
    suited as a team effort. if there was a team of individuals tasked with this.<br><br>
    <b>2.3.2 What would you change?</b><br> <br>
    How it is planned, I would focus a whole day on planning and then initiate the plan in stages as opposed to taking on all<br>
    tasks at once with the idea of a fully functioning website.

    <b>2.4 Describe further improvements you can make to your project.</b> <br><br>
    Improvements to the project would involve separating the workload and making it a team effort instead of a solo journey,<br>
    I think that this particular part of the course would have been much easier if we weren't all heading for the solo mission.<br>
    Having expired all the tasks and plans on Trello, I began to focus my time on things I had thought needed changing and ended up making more work for myself.<br>
    I hope to avoid this in the future.</p>

    <b>2.5 Review outcomes to make sure they match requirements and are fit for purpose.</b><br><br>
    Originall the overall outcome was below what I had hoped to achieve, I had bitten off more than I could chew,<br>
     in future I believe the following would make it more successful in order to meet target.<br>
     <p>
<ol>
    <li>Having a team to work on each part of the project whilst i focus on the site content.</li>
    <li>Continue to study the ins and outs of html, xhtml, scss, css and js for better site production</li>
    <li>Have someone manage the Trello board instead of taking on the task of doing all things at once, Trello, Slack, Content and the cascading style sheet.</li>
    <li>Remove myself and my own inhibitions as distractions and focus more on the content then add the aesthetics later.
</ol> <p>I had originally desired to do this but had gotten overwhelmed with all the other tasks that required my attention.</p>
